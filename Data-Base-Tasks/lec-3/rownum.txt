ROWNUM is assigned row by row as rows are fetched, before the WHERE clause is applied.

Step-by-step what happens:

Oracle reads the first row

Assigns ROWNUM = 1

Checks the condition:
rownum = 2 → ❌ false
→ row is discarded

Since the first row was discarded, Oracle never reaches row 2

➡️ Therefore, ROWNUM = 2 can never be true in a direct WHERE clause.




Correct way to get row number 2
✅ Use a subquery

select name, rn
from (
    select name, rownum rn
    from employees
)
where rn = 2;


✔ This works because:

ROWNUM is assigned first

Then filtered using the alias rn
